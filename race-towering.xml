			<p>As a forest guardian, you have a natural knack for stealth and a knowledge of the world around you. In the worlds of D&amp;D, forest guardians are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using steath to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest guardians tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br />
				<span class="feature">The Forest and the Trees.</span>You have proficiency in the Nature skill.<br />
				<span class="feature">Flexibility.</span>Due to your highly flexible body, you can hide in tight spaces when you need you. You have advantage on all stealth checks.<br />
