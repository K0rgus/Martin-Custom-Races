		<description>
			<p>As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of D&amp;D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br />
				<span class="feature">The Forest and the Trees.</span>You have proficiency in the Nature skill.<br />
				<span class="feature">Flexibility.</span>Despite your height, you have learned to blend into your surroundings. You have advantage on stealth checks.<br />

		<description>
			<p>As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&amp;D are rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Constitution score increases by 1.<br />
				<span class="feature">Artificer’s Lore.</span>Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.<br />
				<span class="feature">Tinker.</span>You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.<br />
			</p>
			<p>When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p>
			<p style="margin-left:20px;">
				<span style="font-style:italic;padding-right:5px;padding-left:-20px;">Clockwork Toy.</span>This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.<br />
				<span style="font-style:italic;padding-right:5px;padding-left:-20px;">Fire Starter.</span>The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.<br />
				<span style="font-style:italic;padding-right:5px;padding-left:-20px;">Music Box.</span>When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.<br />
